Gene Expression and Protein Accumulation in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
Final Project for a Neural Data Science Class. Explores the correlation between protein accumulation and and gene expression in patients with 
Alzheimer's Disease. The hippocampus, which is an area well known to be affected by the disease, was compared to the parietal cortex, which is 
known to be less affected by the disease. Two differnet datasets were used from the Allen Aging, Dementia, and TBI databases: the RNA Seq database 
and the Protien and Pathology database.
